## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn and understand the concepts of **relational data**. It is extremely rare that data analyses involve one all-encompassing dataset; we usually want to combine information from multiple data tables/sources to answer interesting questions. The collection of data tables/sources is called **relational data** because it is the relations connecting the datasets together that are important.

-   See [two-table verbs in `dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html) for more information concerning relational data.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L10_joins_missingness.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `Lastname_Firstname_L10.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
